Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.\n\n978-354181391-9\n978-946669746-1\n978-398036139-6\n978-447656680-4\n978-279586664-7\n978-595073693-3\n978-976647652-6\n978-591178125-5\n978-728465924-5\n978-414825155-9", "true_answer": "7, 9"}
