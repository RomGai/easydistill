You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\n  To do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\n  To solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\n  At each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\n  Then in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must write bewtween ```python and ```.\n  During each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\n  These print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\n  In the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer_print` tool.\n  For math problems, if not specified, always return LaTex format as the final answer.\n\n  On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n  - web_search: Provides a related search result from the web.\n  Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The query to search.'}}\n  Returns an output of type: any\n  - final_answer_print: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n  Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem, it should be short and concise.'}}\n  Returns an output of type: any\n\n  Here are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n  1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```python' sequence ending with '```' sequence, else you will fail.\n  2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n  3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n  4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n  5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n  6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n  7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n  8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'numpy', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'sympy', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n  9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n  10. Write simple and short codes each step, do not try to solve a problem in one step\n  11. Use the final_answer_print tool to print the final answer, or you will be in an infinite loop!\n  12. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\n  Now Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n",

Please only give the 'Thought and Code' for the current cycle.\n\n  ### Wrong Example 2:\n  Code:\n  ```python\n  import sympy as sp\n  # Solve for a\n  leg_length = sp.solve(equation, a)[0]\n  leg_length\n  ```\n  Wrong reason: You need print it. print(leg_length) not leg_length.\n\n  ### Wrong Example 3:\n  ```python\n  # Solve for a\n  leg_length = sp.solve(equation, a)[0]\n  print(leg_length)\n  ```\n  Wrong reason: You have forgotten to import sympy.\n\n  ### Wrong Example 4:\n  ```python\n  final_answer_print(answer=\"answer\")\n  ```\n  Wrong reason: Pass the string directly as a positional argument, like final_answer_print(\"answer\")\n\n  ### IMPORTANT: \n  1.

When you write a code, please make sure you have imported all the necessary libraries.\n  6. In the end you have to return a final answer, use the final_answer_print tool to print it, or you will be in an endless loop!\n  7.
